BAli-Phy does NOT detect how many iterations is sufficient:
   You need to monitor convergence and kill it when done.
   Maximum number of iterations set to 32000.

You can examine 'C1.log' using BAli-Phy tool statreport (command-line) or the BEAST program Tracer (graphical).
See the manual at http://www.bali-phy.org/README.xhtml for further information.
