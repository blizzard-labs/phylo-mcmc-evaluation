#=GF CC   This family is found in alpha and beta proteobacteria. Family
#=GF CC   members include anti-sigma factor CnrY from Cupriavidus
#=GF CC   metallidurans. Sigma factors are multi-domain sub-units of
#=GF CC   bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) that play critical roles in
#=GF CC   transcription initiation, including the recognition and opening
#=GF CC   of promoters as well as the initial steps in RNA synthesis. They
#=GF CC   also control a wide variety of adaptive responses such as
#=GF CC   morphological development and the management of stress. A
#=GF CC   recurring theme in sigma factor control is their sequestration
#=GF CC   by anti-sigma factors that occlude their RNAP-binding
#=GF CC   determinants [1].  CnrH, controls cobalt and nickel resistance
#=GF CC   in Cupriavidus metallidurans. CnrH is regulated by a complex of
#=GF CC   two transmembrane proteins: the periplasmic sensor CnrX and the
#=GF CC   anti-sigma CnrY. At rest, CnrH is sequestered by CnrY whose
#=GF CC   45-residue-long cytosolic domain is one of the shortest
#=GF CC   anti-sigma domains. Upon Ni(II) or Co(II) ions detection by CnrX
#=GF CC   in the periplasm, CnrH is released between CnrH and the
#=GF CC   cytosolic domain of CnrY (CnrYc). The CnrH/CnrYC complex
#=GF CC   displays an unexpected structural similarity to the anti-sigma
#=GF CC   NepR in complex with its antagonist PhyR, whereas NepR shares no
#=GF CC   sequence similarity with CnrY. Crystal structure of CnrH/CnrY
#=GF CC   shows that CnrYC residues 3-19 are folded as a well-defined
#=GF CC   alpha-helix. The peptide further extends along the hydrophobic
#=GF CC   groove of sigma 2 with no canonical structure except for a short
#=GF CC   helical turn spanning residues 24-28. CnrY has a hydrophobic
#=GF CC   knob made of V4, W7 and L8 side chains protruding into sigma 4
#=GF CC   hydrophobic pocket and contributing to the interface. In vivo
#=GF CC   investigation of CnrY function pinpoints part of the hydrophobic
#=GF CC   knob as a hotspot in CnrH inhibitory binding [2].
