#=GF CC   The members of this family resemble neurotoxin B-IV
#=GF CC   (Swiss:P01525), which is a crustacean-selective neurotoxin
#=GF CC   produced by the marine worm Cerebratulus lacteus. This highly
#=GF CC   cationic peptide is approximately 55 residues and is arranged to
#=GF CC   form two antiparallel helices connected by a well-defined loop
#=GF CC   in a hairpin structure. The branches of the hairpin are linked
#=GF CC   by four disulphide bonds. Three residues identified as being
#=GF CC   important for activity, namely Arg-17, -25 and -34, are found on
#=GF CC   the same face of the molecule, while another residue important
#=GF CC   for activity, Trp30, is on the opposite side. The protein's mode
#=GF CC   of action is not entirely understood, but it may act on
#=GF CC   voltage-gated sodium channels, possibly by binding to an as yet
#=GF CC   uncharacterised site on these proteins. Its site of interaction
#=GF CC   may also be less specific, for example it may interact with
#=GF CC   negatively charged membrane lipids [1].
