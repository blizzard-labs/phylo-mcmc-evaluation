#=GF CC   Fimbriae are cell-surface protein polymers, of eg. E coli and
#=GF CC   Salmonella spp, that mediate interactions important for host and
#=GF CC   environmental persistence, development of biofilms, motility,
#=GF CC   colonisation and invasion of cells, and conjugation. Four
#=GF CC   general assembly pathways for different fimbriae have been
#=GF CC   proposed, one of which is extracellular nucleation-precipitation
#=GF CC   (ENP), that differs from the others in that fibre-growth occurs
#=GF CC   extracellularly. Thin aggregative fimbriae (Tafi) are the only
#=GF CC   fimbriae dependent on the ENP pathway. Tafi were first
#=GF CC   identified in Salmonella spp and the controlling operon termed
#=GF CC   agf; however subsequent isolation of the homologous operon in E
#=GF CC   coli led to its being called csg. Tafi are known as curli
#=GF CC   because, in the absence of extracellular polysaccharides, their
#=GF CC   morphology appears curled; however, when expressed with such
#=GF CC   polysaccharides their morphology appears as a tangled amorphous
#=GF CC   matrix. The gene agfC is found to be transcribed at low levels,
#=GF CC   localised to the periplasm in a mature form, and in combination
#=GF CC   with AgfE is important for AgfA extracellular assembly, which
#=GF CC   facilitates the synthesis of Tafi. The genes involved in Tafi
#=GF CC   production are organised into two adjacent divergently
#=GF CC   transcribed operons, agfBAC and agfDEFG, both of which are
#=GF CC   required for biosynthesis and assembly [1].
