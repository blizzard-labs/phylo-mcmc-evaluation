Pfams and trees from Pfam v36 seed alignments (trees generated by FastTree program with default parameters)


Seed alignment/Tree cleaning:
-----------------------------
Removed sequences from trees AND alignments if:
- unaligned sequence is <10 amino acids
- MSA only contained one sequence (removed the pfam and the tree entirely)
- sequence contains invalid letters: B, O, U, X, Z

Other steps
- if amino acid sequence is duplicated within a PFam, kept only the first instance in the file
- if amino acid sequence is duplicated across PFams, removed it from the dataset entirely
- changed all lowercase letters to uppercase


Mapping SCOP identifiers:
--------------------------
For each pfam:
- Used PDB database to extract all possible PDB identifiers
- Mapped PDB identifiers to SCOP classes
- Kept pfam if it only had one unique SCOP class label
